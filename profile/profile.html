Well, once upon a time...Just kidding, here's some Bob Ross ipsum: God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Every time you practice, you learn more. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. In life you need colors. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. We can fix anything. Let your imagination be your guide. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. You can get away with a lot.
